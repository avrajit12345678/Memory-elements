# Memory Elements

This repository includes Verilog modules for RAM and ROM.

## RAM Module

The RAM (Random Access Memory) module allows both reading and writing of data. It is parameterized by width and depth to allow for flexible memory configurations.

## ROM Module

The ROM (Read-Only Memory) module is initialized with fixed data and only allows reading of that data. It is also parameterized by width and depth to accommodate various memory sizes.

## Usage

These modules can be used in digital design projects where memory elements are required. The RAM module is suitable for applications needing data storage with read/write capabilities, while the ROM module is ideal for storing fixed data that does not change during operation.
